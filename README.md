# Flexa Programming Language

Welcome to the official documentation of the **Flexa Programming Language**! Flexa is a toy scripting language developed for fun.

## Features

- **Simple Syntax**: Flexa's syntax is clean and easy to learn.
- **Strong Typing**: Flexa supports static typing when defined, ensuring safer and more predictable code.
- **Standard Library**: Flexa comes with a comprehensive set of built-in libraries for common tasks like file handling, networking, and data manipulation.
- **Cross-Platform**: Write once, run anywhere. Flexa programs can be executed on multiple platforms without modification.
- **Extensible**: Flexa allows you to create and use custom libraries, making it highly adaptable to your needs.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Flexa**: Download and install the Flexa interpretor from the [official repository](https://github.com/flexa-script/interpreter).
2. **Write Your First Program**: Create a `.flx` file and start coding! Here's a simple example:

    ```flexa
    println("Hello, Flexa!");
    ```

3. **Run Your Program**: Use the Flexa interpretor to execute your code:

    ```bash
    flexa run hello_world.flx
    ```
