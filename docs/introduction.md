# Introduction to Flexa

Welcome to the **Flexa Programming Language**! Flexa is a toy scripting language developed for fun.

---

## What is Flexa?

Flexa is a statically-typed, general-purpose scripting language that emphasizes simplicity, readability, and flexibility. It combines the best features of modern programming languages with a clean and intuitive syntax, making it easy to learn and use.

### Key Features
- **Simple and Clean Syntax**: Flexa's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, reducing the cognitive load on developers.
- **Strong Typing with Type Inference**: Flexa ensures type safety while allowing you to omit type declarations when the type can be inferred.
- **Standard Library**: Flexa comes with a comprehensive set of built-in libraries for tasks like file handling, networking, data manipulation, and more.
- **Cross-Platform**: Flexa programs can run on multiple platforms without modification, thanks to its portable runtime.
- **Extensible**: Flexa allows you to create and use custom libraries, making it highly adaptable to your specific needs.

## Getting Started

To start using Flexa, you'll need to:
1. **Install the Flexa Interpreter**: Download and install the Flexa interpreter and runtime from the [official repository](https://github.com/flexa-script).
2. **Write Your First Program**: Create a `.flx` file and write your code. Here's a simple example:

   ```flexa
   println("Hello, Flexa!");
   ```

3. **Run Your Program**: Use the Flexa interpreter to execute your code:

   ```bash
   ./flexa ./hello_world.flx
   ```

4. **Explore the Documentation**: Continue learning about Flexa by reading the [Basic Syntax](basic-syntax) guide.
