## Common Issues

### 1. **Error: "Variable not found"**
   - **Cause**: The variable is out of scope or not declared.
   - **Solution**: Ensure the variable is declared and accessible in the current scope.

### 2. **Error: "Type mismatch"**
   - **Cause**: The value assigned to a variable does not match its declared type.
   - **Solution**: Check the variable's type and ensure the assigned value is compatible.

### 3. **Error: "Division by zero"**
   - **Cause**: Attempting to divide a number by zero.
   - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure the divisor is not zero before performing the division.

### 4. **Error: "File not found"**
   - **Cause**: The file path provided does not exist or is incorrect.
   - **Solution**: Verify the file path and ensure the file exists.

### 5. **Error: "Unexpected token"**
   - **Cause**: A syntax error in the code.
   - **Solution**: Review the code around the reported line for syntax errors.

### 6. **Performance Issues**
   - **Cause**: Inefficient code or excessive resource usage.
   - **Solution**: Optimize your code, avoid unnecessary computations, and use built-in libraries effectively.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Check the Documentation**: Many issues can be resolved by referring to the [Language Reference](language-reference) or other sections of the documentation.
2. **Use Debugging Tools**: Print debug messages using `println` to trace the flow of your program and identify issues.
3. **Search the Community**: If you're stuck, search the Flexa community forums or GitHub issues for similar problems.
4. **Ask for Help**: If you can't find a solution, don't hesitate to ask for help in the Flexa community.
